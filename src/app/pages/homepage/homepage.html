      <h1>Vizient Components for the Web</h1>
      <p>
        The toolkit system includes the resources needed to create user interfaces consistent with the Vizientâ€™s product principles,
        design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on the application logic,
        while designers can focus on user experiences, interactions, and flows.
